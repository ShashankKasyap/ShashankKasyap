Hi, I’m Shashank 👋  

I’m an MSc Cybersecurity student, intentionally preparing for a **Junior SOC Analyst (Blue Team)** role.

My focus is on **fundamentals-first security analysis** — understanding logs, authentication behaviour, and analyst reasoning before touching advanced tools.

Career Focus:
- Target role: Junior SOC Analyst / Junior Security Analyst
- Core interests:
  - Authentication and access logs
  - Linux and SSH behaviour
  - Identifying noise vs security-relevant signals
  - Evidence-based incident reasoning

Learning Approach:
- Learn slowly and deliberately
- Understand *what happens*, *why it happens*, and *how it appears in real SOC environments*
- Use Github to document thinking, not just commands

Current Work:
- Building SOC-focused labs around:
  - Linux authentication logs
  - SSH successful and failed login patterns
  - Analyst-style documentation and conclusion
 
Status:
- Final-phase MSc Cybersecurity student
- Actively restructuring Github for SOC readiness
